If you are planning to follow the next lab, here is a [link](wip-link) to the gated service endpoint.

### Environment

**URLs:**

Check with your instruction the *GUID* number of your current workshop environment. Replace the actual number on all the URLs where you find **GUID**. 

Example in case of *GUID* = **1234**: 

```bash
https://master.GUID.openshiftworkshop.com
```

becomes =>

```bash
https://master.1234.openshiftworkshop.com
```

Your username is your asigned user number. For example, if you are assigned user number **1**, your username is: 

```bash

```

The password to login is always the same:

```bash
r3dh4t1!
```
